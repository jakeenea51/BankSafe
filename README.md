*Only put sample code under the Sample Code folder. All work done on the banking application is to be done in the Banking Application folder only.*

## Accessing the code
These steps only need to be done once:
1. Download Visual Studio Code
2. Select "Clone Repository"
3. Log in to your GitHub account
4. Select this repository
5. Save the repository locally on your computer

Once these steps have been completed once, they do not need to be done again. To access the code again simply select the location you saved the repository on your computer.

*To make sure you are up to date on all the changes that have been made, I recommend clicking the "Synchronize Changes" icon at the bottom of the screen every time you open the code.*

## Running the code
To run the code, simply select the file you would like to run and click the "Run Java" play button icon in the top right. 

## Making changes
- To enter the changes you have made, go to "Source Control", on the left hand side, and click the check icon to "Commit and Push".
- Make sure to put a comment when committing a change to describe what changes were made.
